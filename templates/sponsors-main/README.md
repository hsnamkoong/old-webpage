### FAQ

**What version of Hugo Extended does a template support?**

The supported version of Hugo can be found under `HUGO_VERSION` in a template's `netlify.toml` file.

**How can I install Hugo Extended?**

Check out the [Hugo installation guide](https://docs.hugoblox.com/getting-started/install-hugo/).

However, **most users find it easier _not_ to install Hugo**. The easiest way to edit your site is online with the GitHub Editor or GitHub Codespaces (the online version of VSCode), as used in the tutorials.

**How can I use Tailwind Blox in a Bootstrap Template and vice-versa?**

No, Tailwind and Bootstrap are two different CSS styling frameworks and cannot be used together.
