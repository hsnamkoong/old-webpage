## Get Started

We'll use a Markdown editor, Typora, to edit your site, then upload it to GitHub, and deploy it with Netlify. No need to install Hugo üòÉ

**Why GitHub?** So you can edit your site with collaborators, track changes, and request assistance from the community if needed.

**Why Netlify?** Netlify makes it easy to deploy a Hugo/Wowchemy site for free whilst giving your visitors the fastest experience.

**Get Started:**

1. Download this template (such as from GitHub by clicking the green _Code_ button and then _Download ZIP_)
1. Extract the ZIP in your _Downloads_ folder
1. Download [Typora](https://typora.io/), open the app, and choose _File > Open_ to open the extracted folder
1. Edit your **profile** in `content/authors/admin/_index.md` - add your name as the `title` and optionally, a role/tagline and your organization
1. Add your **resume/CV** to `static/uploads/resume.pdf` or delete the example resume file and remove the link to it in `content/authors/admin/_index.md`
1. Add a square-cropped **photo of yourself** named `avatar` to the `content/authors/admin/` folder to replace the example photo
1. Add a **background photo** to `static/media/hello.jpg` (ideally, resize to max 2500px wide, crop to a banner shape, and [optimize it](https://tinypng.com/))

1. **Upload your site** by clicking the _uploading an existing file_ link and then click _choose your files_ to select all the files in your site folder (not the folder itself)
1. Login to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/), click _New Site from Git_, and login to GitHub to select your new site
1. **Personalize your site URL** in the Netlify dashboard or add your [domain](https://wowchemy.com/docs/hugo-tutorials/domain/)
